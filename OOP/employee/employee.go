// since employee is unexported, itâ€™s not possible to create values of type Employee from other packages. Hence we are providing an exported New function which takes the required parameters as input and returns a newly created employee.

// we have created an employee struct and attached a method named leavesremaining()
// the struct and method together is akined to a class
